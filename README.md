# ReleasePad

ReleasePad is an internal mobile app distribution and testing platform designed to manage, distribute, and evaluate internal Android builds.

It helps teams keep track of multiple APKs, control tester access, collect feedback, and monitor crashes in a single place.

## Why ReleasePad

Managing internal builds across multiple apps and versions becomes difficult as projects scale. ReleasePad was created to simplify internal distribution and feedback without relying on public app stores.

## Tech Stack

* Flutter (mobile app)
* Supabase (authentication, storage, database)
* Android APK distribution (initial focus)

## Planned Features (MVP)

* Email-based tester authentication
* App and build listing
* Secure APK download
* Tester feedback collection
* Basic crash reporting

## Project Status

ReleasePad is under active development and is intended for internal and experimental use.
